# BikeShare-Project
In this project, we used data provided by Motivate(https://www.motivateco.com/) a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
